# Tekel Tobacco Factory In Revit
As part of my Bachelor's thesis, I investigated the adaptive reuse of Alsancak's Tekel Tobacco Factory in Ä°zmir. As an underlay for this work, I modeled the factory grounds and landscape in Revit with the aid of government survey data for conservation of the heritage site.


The factory is comprised of 9 buildings and 3 entrance security shelters. Made by the French in the 19th century, it features a mixed construction of bricks, concrete, steel, and timber. Most common structure organisation is the concrete basement and foundation, reinforced brick outer walls, steel inner columns, and a timber roof structure.


The factory was modeled with the later 20th and 21st century additions removed, such as the 2 storey kindergarten added on top of an inner courtyard.
